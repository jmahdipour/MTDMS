# Project Name

Mechanical Testing Data Management System

(MTDMS)

---

# Purpose

Design and develop an industrial mechanical testing software completely inside Microsoft Excel 2019 using VBA.

The software shall replace commercial software for universal testing machines while remaining easy to deploy inside laboratories.

---

# Primary Goal

Develop an integrated software capable of

- Importing TXT files
- Processing raw mechanical test data
- Performing engineering calculations
- Correcting graphs
- Producing reports
- Managing projects
- Maintaining material libraries
- Working according to ISO/IEC 17025

---

# Secondary Goals

• Modular architecture

• Expandable standards

• Machine independent

• Database driven

• Offline operation

---

# Input

TXT files exported from testing machines.

TXT is the only accepted source.

---

# Output

Engineering Results

Stress–Strain Graph

PDF Report

Excel Report

SQLite Database
